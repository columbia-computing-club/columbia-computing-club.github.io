# Introduction

Now that we've explored some basics with Lupe, we can see how it works in R Markdown. If you haven't before, you will want to install `tinytex::install_tinytex()` in order for RMarkdown documents to be rendered as .pdfs using \LaTeX.

Let's pretend to do some work on the `tidyverse` dataset `diamonds`. This was we can also show how to incorporate nice tables and plots into our RMarkdown document.

\section{Formatting}

\begin{itemize}

\item When working in an R Markdown file, there are multiple ways to produce the same formatting. For example, I use \text{section\{\}} above, but I could also use a hashtag, like I did to make the introduction header. Similarly \text{subsection\{\}}  will correlate to a double hashtag, and so on.

\end{itemize}

* There are also multiple way to italicize and bold your text. You can either do \textit{this}, or you can use the *R Markdown* way. And for boldface, you can use the \textbf{\LaTeX} way or the **R Markdown** way.

* Finally, there are 2 ways to bullet point. One if by using the asterisk, and the other is by using an `\itemize{}` environment, as is done above.

Just be careful when trying to use R Markdown conventional formatting _inside_ \text{\LaTeX} environments! This can lead to issues you may have to troubleshoot.

# Tables and Plots

\subsection{Plots}

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gtsummary)
```

Including plots into your homework is easy enough and you may already know how to do it. One way is to simply just print the plot out from an R Markdown chunk.

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

However, you may not know that you can format your plot using \text{\LaTeX}-ish commands in the code chunk header...

```{r figure 1, fig.align = 'center', out.width = "80%", fig.cap = "Diamonds by carat and price", message = FALSE}
diamonds %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = carat, y = price))
```

And if I take a screenshot of my plot, or have a different picture. I can include it using this technique as well

![Diamonds by carat and price](plot_pic.png)

And there's even one more technique!

```{r}
library(knitr)
include_graphics("plot_pic.png")
```

## Tables

```{r}
diamonds %>% head() %>% gt::gt()
dim(diamonds)
```


```{r}
diamonds_data <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(
    quality2 = case_when(
      cut %in% c("Fair", "Good") & carat < 3 ~ "okay",
      cut %in% c("Good", "Very Good") & carat > 3 & carat <= 4.5 ~ "good",
      cut %in% c("Very Good", "Premium", "Ideal") & carat > 4.5 ~ "great",
      TRUE ~ "neither"
    )
  )
diamonds_data %>% head() %>% gt::gt()
```


## `group_by()` and `summarise()`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(clarity) %>% # group_by has to come before summarise to get group-level summary statistics
  summarise(
    mean_price = mean(price),
    count = n()
  )  %>% # I can create +1 summary statistics at a time
  gt::gt()
```


## `gtsummary`

Here I am making a table one using `gtsummary`'s `tbl_summary` function. I am grouping by cut and adding an overal column and p values. The bolded labels are just to make it look pretty.

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = cut) %>% # calling the table one summary compand 
  add_overall() %>% # adding overall column
  bold_labels() %>% # making labels look nice
  add_p() # adding p values
```

This is a more complex gt summary example.  Here we are controlling the type of statistic variables that are going to be displayed. 

```{r}
diamonds %>% 
  tbl_summary(by = cut,
              type = all_continuous() ~ "continuous2",
              statistic = list( # we need to specify the stats by the type of variable
                all_continuous() ~ c("{mean} ({sd})", 
                                     "{median} ({p25}, {p75})",
                                     "{min}, {max}"),
                all_categorical() ~ "{n} / {N} ({p}%)"
              )) %>%
  add_overall() %>%
  bold_labels() %>%
  add_p()
```
