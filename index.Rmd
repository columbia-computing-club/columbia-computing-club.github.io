<h1 style="text-align:center">Welcome to the Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club!</h1>

<p>

<img src="images/columbia_biostatistics.png" style="width:50%" align="left" hspace="20"> The Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club hosts casual seminars focusing on computational topics often encountered in biostatistics research. These tutorials provide hands-on learning at a variety of skill levels, with some focused on bringing new students up to speed and others addressing more advanced problems. Our overarching goal is to impart good programming practices that encourage collaborative reproducible research!

This year's organizers are [Amy Pitts](https://amypitts01.github.io/), Safiya Sirota, Guadalupe Antonio Lopez, Gustavo Garcia-Franceschini and Kate Colvin. In the doctoral program, Amy is in her fifth year, Safiya is in her fourth year, while Guadalupe and Gustavo are both in their second year, and Kate is starting her first year. The group is run with the help of faculty advisor [Christine Mauro](http://christinemauro.com/). A schedule for the upcoming  events is below and will be regularly updated. Please fill out this [survey](https://forms.gle/MqpPYUmi3ivYqU4A9) to let us know what topics you are most interested in. For other inquiries, you can contact ajp2257@cumc.columbia.edu.
