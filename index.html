			<h1>Welcome to the Columbia Biostatistics Computing Club!</h1>

		  <p>The computing club hosts casual seminars focusing on computational topics often encountered in biostatistics
				research.  The tutorials provide hands-on learning at a variety of skill levels,
				with some focused on bringing new students up to speed and others addressing more advanced problems.
				Our overarching goal is to impart good programming practices that encourage collaborative
				 reproducible research!</p>

			<p>The club meets monthly on <b>Mondays from 4:00-5:00pm in Hammer LL204.</b>	 </p>
